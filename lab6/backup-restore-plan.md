# Restoration plan

## Backup restoration process
1. Incident has been spawned by monitoring systems after detecting service failure.
2. An on-call engineer tries to troubleshoot and resolve the incident.
3. If the service restoration needs a backup recovery, this will be decided by TDO/EDO.
4. Restoration from backups will be done as a manual process by on-call engineer after TDO/EDO approval.
